# Actors_in_movies
A Project for my CS 216 course
it reads data from an input file which passes as command line argument then stores in an object of IMDB class (to represent imdb database) 
two movies are from the user-input, then performs case insensitive matching and match the movie titles from the database
it then allowes user to input an actor/actress name, to search for co-actors in each movie which this actor/actress was in, in a well-formatted display
